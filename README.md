VariousScripts
==============

A repo for nothing in particular...

* OpenIOC2CIF.py - The script will process a file in the OpenIOC (.ioc) format and parse out indicators that the [Collective Intelligence Framework](http://code.google.com/p/collective-intelligence-framework/) can accept. The indicators are returned in a .tsv that can be used as a CIF feed.
* PairSort.py - Processes a file with two comma separated values per line and produces an output file with unique pairs, by value
